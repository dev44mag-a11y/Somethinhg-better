# 🌴 Tropical Revolution: Enhanced Edition - README 🌴

## 📜 About the Game
In *Tropical Revolution*, you’re the glorious (or soon-to-be-exiled) leader of a fictional island nation that’s equal parts paradise and powder keg. Your job? Keep the economy from tanking, the people from rioting, and the military from staging a "surprise retirement party" for you. Choose your economic flavor—laissez-faire for the capitalist sharks, communism for the red-flag-waving idealists, fascism for the boot-polishing enthusiasts, or populism for those who think handing out free coconuts solves everything. Spoiler: it doesn’t. Every choice you make has consequences, and most of them are hilariously catastrophic.

With dynamic maps, day-night cycles, and enough random crises to make you question your life choices, this game is a masterclass in how to screw up a tropical utopia. Will you build schools or battleships? Bribe the capitalists or arm the rebels? Whatever you do, don’t expect the locals to send you a fruit basket.

## 🎮 Features (or Ways to Ruin Everything)
- **Dynamic Island Maps**: Choose from coastal, volcanic, or archipelago settings. Each map is a fresh canvas for your inevitable downfall.
- **Economic Systems**: Pick your poison—laissez-faire, interventionism, communism, fascism, or populism. Watch laissez-faire make the rich richer while the poor plot your demise, or try communism and enjoy bread lines by the beach. Populism? Sure, everyone loves free stuff… until the economy implodes.
- **Factions Galore**: Juggle capitalists, communists, nationalists, religious zealots, militarists, and populists. They all hate you, but some hate you *more*.
- **Crises and Rebels**: From earthquakes to foreign invasions to communist guerrillas seizing your best banana plantation, randomness keeps you on your toes (or in a bunker).
- **Military Might**: Command ground troops, naval fleets, and air forces. Nothing says “stability” like a good old-fashioned tank parade.
- **Investments**: Throw money at education, healthcare, or green energy. Or don’t, and watch your island turn into a post-apocalyptic surf resort.
- **Audio-Visual Flair**: Tropical tunes, dramatic sound effects, and weather animations make every crisis feel like a blockbuster disaster movie.
- **Difficulty Levels**: Easy (for cowards), Medium (for optimists), Hard (for masochists), and Expert (for those who hate themselves).

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repo**: Grab this hot mess of code with `git clone`. If you don’t know what that means, maybe stick to playing solitaire.
2. **Assets**: You’ll need some files we didn’t include because, frankly, we’re not your art department. Scrounge up:
   - `background-day.jpg`, `background-night.jpg` (for that oh-so-pretty day/night cycle).
   - `map-coastal.jpg`, `map-volcanic.jpg`, `map-archipelago.jpg` (for your doomed island).
   - `rain.gif` (because nothing says "crisis" like a soggy rebellion).
   - Audio files: `tropical-ambient.mp3` (to set the mood), `action-click.mp3` (for that satisfying click when you ruin everything), and `crisis-alert.mp3` (for when the rebels are knocking).
   Pro tip: Steal some royalty-free assets or make your own if you’re feeling artsy.
3. **Run It**: Toss the HTML file into a browser. No server needed, because we’re keeping it simple while you make complex mistakes.
4. **Play**: Click buttons, watch numbers go up (or down), and pray your island doesn’t end up as a case study in “How to Fail at Governance 101.”

## 🛠️ How to Play (or How to Lose Spectacularly)
- **Objective**: Keep your island from collapsing into anarchy while balancing stability, economy, support, and military control. Bonus points if you don’t get exiled by Turno 5.
- **Actions**: Spend your budget on schools, tanks, or populist handouts. Each choice has trade-offs, like trading your dignity for a fleeting 5% approval bump.
- **Economic Systems**: Switch regimes with the “Mudar Regime” button. Laissez-faire builds wealth but makes you look like a heartless tycoon. Populism wins hearts until the money runs out. Communism? Good luck with that.
- **Crises**: Random events like earthquakes or rebel uprisings will test your ability to panic under pressure. Pro tip: Panicking doesn’t help.
- **Victory**: Achieve 90% stability, 80% economy, 85% support, and a $10B GDP. Or just survive long enough to brag about it.
- **Game Over**: If stability hits 0%, congratulations, you’re on a one-way ticket to a non-extradition country.

## 😈 Pro Tips (From One Despot to Another)
- **Laissez-faire**: Let the market run wild, but don’t be surprised when the communists start sharpening their pitchforks.
- **Populism**: Hand out free stuff like it’s a piñata party. Just don’t expect the economy to thank you later.
- **Military**: More tanks = fewer problems, until you realize tanks don’t fix unemployment.
- **Rebels**: Ignore them, and they’ll turn your capital into a warzone. Negotiate, and they’ll demand your firstborn. Good luck!
- **Save Your Budget**: You’ll need it when the inevitable hurricane/rebellion/corruption scandal trifecta hits.

## 🐛 Known Bugs (Because Perfection Is Boring)
- The economy might implode faster than a real-world banana republic. Working as intended.
- Rebels sometimes seize zones just to flex. We’re calling it “immersion.”
- Audio files might not play if you forgot to add them. That’s on you, not us.
- If the game crashes, just pretend it’s a metaphor for your leadership skills.

## 🤡 Contributing
Want to make this disaster even more disastrous? Fork the repo, add your own brand of chaos, and send a pull request. Ideas we’d love to see:
- A “Bribe the Press” action to fake your approval ratings.
- A “Zombie Apocalypse” crisis for extra spice.
- More sarcastic event messages to keep players laughing through the pain.

## 💀 Final Words
*Tropical Revolution: Enhanced Edition* is the game for anyone who’s ever wanted to rule a nation with the finesse of a toddler in a candy store. It’s a love letter to bad decisions, tropical vibes, and the sweet, sweet taste of power (until it all goes wrong). So grab a piña colada, crank up the tropical tunes, and lead your island to glory—or a gloriously hilarious collapse.

**Disclaimer**: No actual islands were harmed in the making of this game. Your sanity, however, is not guaranteed.
